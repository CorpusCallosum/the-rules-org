This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.0.0.

## Install the Angular CLI and Node Packages

First thing's first--
If you don't already have it, install the Angular CLI globally on your computer by running `sudo npm install -g @angular/cli@latest`

Install the node package by running `sudo npm install`


## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive/pipe/service/class/module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

For building to test on gh-pages, use the command `npm run build-ghp`. This script is defined in package.json

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
