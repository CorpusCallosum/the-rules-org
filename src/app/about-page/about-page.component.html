      <h2>About The Rules</h2>
      <p>
        In 2012, The Rules started out asking why poverty still existed. In looking for the answers, we have grown into a global collective of activists, writers, artists and academics who work to expose the root causes of not just poverty but also of  inequality and climate change.
      </p>
      <p>
        What we have learned in that time is how much stories shape the world, and also how they can help change it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Narratives can be used to explain how power has come to rest in the hands of the few, rather than the many.  They reveal how our struggles - from land to labour, biodiversity to our very bodies - are part of the same global system, one that prioritises the production of capital - in other words, economic growth - over everything else, and at the expense of everything else.
      </p>
      <p>
        We call that system neoliberal capitalism. Aside from revealing it to be at the root of the crises of our civilisation, we tell stories about alternative systems emerging so that people see that they have the power to change the rules. Finally, we connect the movements working in diverse ways to resist, and reimagine the world.
      </p>

      <h2>What we do</h2>
      <p>There are several ways in which we work to make the radical idea of a post-capitalist world commonsense:</p>

      The Activist Ashram: The Activist Ashram is a year-long fellowship for front-line organisers, with strong community ties. It provides a space for solidarity building for individuals facing up to oppression around the world. Combining both in-person and virtual sessions, fellows are able to examine how their various struggles are related, as well as share safe space, experiences, analysis, wisdom, and organising tactics. The programme, co-created with the fellows, focuses on the holistic aspects of activism and the spiritual aspects of the struggle.

      The Culture Hack Lab: The CHL is the space where we work to better understand what stories are shaping culture. We seek to answer questions such as: what are the stories we believe and share about how the world works? How do these stories help sustain the way human beings or the environment are defined by the economy? The CHL test the ways of effectively changing those stories over time, so as to change our culture.

      The TR online community: Across our various social networks we’re nurturing conversations with individuals and organisations who share the belief that our capitalist system needs to be replaced with a myriad of local alternatives that value people and planet. Whether on Facebook, YouTube, Instagram or Twitter, we want create a space for debate, inspiration and collaboration.
      The Alternative Narrative Network: The media in all its forms is a powerful tool to explain the multiple crises of our age; to give hope by revealing alternative ways of seeing and being and to give voice to the people and communities working to change the world. The ANN is a resource and a community for those working in the media who wish to be part of the story of transition.
