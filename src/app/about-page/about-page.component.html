      <h2>About The Rules</h2>
      <p>
        In 2012, The Rules started out asking why poverty still existed. In looking for the answers, we have grown into a global collective of activists, writers, artists and academics who work to expose the root causes of not just poverty but also of  inequality and climate change.
      </p>
      <p>
        What we have learned in that time is how much stories shape the world, and also how they can help change it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Narratives can be used to explain how power has come to rest in the hands of the few, rather than the many.  They reveal how our struggles - from land to labour, biodiversity to our very bodies - are part of the same global system, one that prioritises the production of capital - in other words, economic growth - over everything else, and at the expense of everything else.
      </p>
      <p>
        We call that system neoliberal capitalism. Aside from revealing it to be at the root of the crises of our civilisation, we tell stories about alternative systems emerging so that people see that they have the power to change the rules. Finally, we connect the movements working in diverse ways to resist, and reimagine the world.
      </p>

      <h2>What we do</h2>
      <p>There are several ways in which we work to make the radical idea of a post-capitalist world commonsense:</p>
