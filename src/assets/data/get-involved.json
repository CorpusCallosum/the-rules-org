      "answerTxt":"As well as in our various social media spaces, it’s also possible to grow your global community by applying for the Activist Ashram. The Ashram is a solidarity network; a space for activists to come together to examine how various struggles are connected as part of a global system of oppression. Solidarity is built through the sharing of stories and experience, analysis, wisdom, friendship and organising tactics. The Ashram also focuses on holistic activism and the spiritual aspects of the struggle. Find out more here: (LINK)"
